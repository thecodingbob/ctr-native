# Third-Party Notices

This project vendors and modifies third-party software. Keep this file with
source and binary distributions of CTR Native.

## PsyCross / Psy-X

Path: `externals/PsyCross`

PsyCross provides the Psy-Q-compatible PS1 hardware abstraction layer used by
CTR Native, including compatible GPU, GTE, SPU, CD, and controller library
interfaces. CTR Native also ports some host-side behavior into its own native
platform layer while preserving Psy-Q-shaped APIs.

CTR Native contains project-owned derivatives of these PsyCross source files:

- `include/platform/native_gpu.h` from `externals/PsyCross/src/gpu/PsyX_GPU.h`
- `include/platform/native_psyx_shell.h` from
  `externals/PsyCross/src/PsyX_main.h`
- `include/platform/native_renderer_backend.h` and
  `include/platform/native_renderer_types.h` from
  `externals/PsyCross/include/PsyX/PsyX_render.h`
- `platform/native_gpu.c` from `externals/PsyCross/src/gpu/PsyX_GPU.cpp`
- `platform/native_gte_core.c` from
  `externals/PsyCross/src/gte/PsyX_GTE.cpp`
- `platform/native_inline_c.c` from `externals/PsyCross/src/psx/INLINE_C.C`
- `platform/native_libapi.c` from `externals/PsyCross/src/psx/LIBAPI.C`
- `platform/native_libetc.c` from `externals/PsyCross/src/psx/LIBETC.C`
- `platform/native_libgte.c`, `platform/native_gte_rcossin_tbl.h`,
  `platform/native_gte_ratan_tbl.h`, and `platform/native_gte_sqrt_tbl.h` from
  `externals/PsyCross/src/psx/LIBGTE.C` and
  `externals/PsyCross/src/gte/*_tbl.h`
- `platform/native_libgpu.c` from `externals/PsyCross/src/psx/LIBGPU.C`
- `platform/native_psyx_shell.c` from
  `externals/PsyCross/src/PsyX_main.cpp`
- `platform/native_renderer_backend.c` from
  `externals/PsyCross/src/render/PsyX_render.cpp`
- `include/platform/native_glad.h` from
  `externals/PsyCross/include/PsyX/common/glad.h`
- `platform/native_glad.c` from `externals/PsyCross/src/render/glad.c`
